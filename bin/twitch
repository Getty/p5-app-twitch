=head1 INSTALL

For installing twitch you need L<Perl|http://www.perl.org/> on your system installed, you can download it on L<http://www.perl.org/>
or for Windows Systems you can use L<http://strawberryperl.com/>. With L<Perl|http://www.perl.org/> you are able to execute the 
C<cpan> command, the so called CPAN client. On Windows Systems you can startup the CPAN client with a link installed on the Strawberry
Perl Start menu folder. You can then inside the cpan client do this:

  cpan[1]> install App::Twitch

All questions inside the installation may be answered with the defaults, just hit enter if it stops :).
  
The installation may take a while, cause Perl checks if all the installed and required modules for this program are working on
your system, with so called tests. This procedure is required to assure you that the application itself runs flawless and without
problems. You may contact Perl people for help on B<irc.perl.org> on B<#win32> or B<#perl-help>. You are always welcome :).

=head2 IF YOU ARE NOT ROOT

If you are not root of the system, you are using for this bot, you should consider using L<local::lib>, which gives you the
possibility to install this package in your userspace. The documentation of L<local::lib> exists in several languages.
